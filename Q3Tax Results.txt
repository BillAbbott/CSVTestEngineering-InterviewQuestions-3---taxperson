
Q3:

I re-read the instructions and completed a solution for Q3. If I'm answering in less than 2 hours, its the one I'd start with and that should have been my answer before.
So I'm including my solution to Q3 and the run-time results below.

Was the complexity of the questions part of the problem, was one supposed to figure out that #3 was easiest and do it first?
